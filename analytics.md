## Teacher Controller Enhancement Plan

Based on the detailed analysis of the teacher dashboard pages and the backend implementation, this section outlines a specific plan to enhance the teacher controller and related services to fully support all teacher features.

### Current Implementation Status

The teacher controller currently has limited functionality compared to the student controller:

1. **Teacher Controller (110 lines)** has only four methods:
   - `getDashboardStats`: Basic dashboard statistics
   - `getScheduleByDay`: Schedule for a specific day
   - `getStudents`: Students taught by a teacher
   - `getCourses`: Courses taught by a teacher

2. **Missing Backend Support**: The frontend teacher dashboard includes several pages that don't have corresponding backend endpoints:
   - Materials management
   - Assignment creation and grading
   - Attendance tracking
   - Document management

### Frontend-Backend Implementation Gap

| Feature | Frontend Status | Backend Status | Gap Analysis |
|---------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Materials | ✅ Complete UI | ❌ Missing in Teacher Controller | Needs dedicated endpoints for teacher materials management |
| Assignments | ✅ Complete UI with service | ⚠️ Partial through generic `/assignments` endpoints | Needs teacher-specific assignment endpoints |
| Attendance | ✅ Complete UI with service | ⚠️ Partial implementation | Needs dedicated teacher attendance tracking endpoints |
| Documents | ⚠️ Basic UI | ❌ Missing in Teacher Controller | Needs document management endpoints for teachers |

    console.error('Error uploading document:', error);
    return sendServerError(res, error.message || 'Failed to upload document');
  }
});
```

#### 4. Enhance Teacher Service with Supporting Methods

```typescript
/**
 * Get materials created by a teacher
 */
async getMaterials(teacherId: string, filters?: {
  courseId?: string;
  type?: 'document' | 'video' | 'quiz' | 'assignment';
  status?: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived';
}) {
  // Verify the teacher exists
  const teacher = await userModel.findById(teacherId);
  if (!teacher || teacher.role !== 'teacher') {
    throw new Error('Teacher not found');
  }

  // Build query filters
  const query: any = { teacherId };
  if (filters?.courseId) query.courseId = filters.courseId;
  if (filters?.type) query.type = filters.type;
  if (filters?.status) query.status = filters.status;

  // Fetch materials from database
  const materials = await materialModel.findByFilters(query);
  return materials;
}

/**
 * Create a new material
 */
async createMaterial(data: {
  title: string;
  type: string;
  courseId: string;
  teacherId: string;
  description?: string;
  content?: string;
  status?: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived';
}) {
  // Verify the teacher exists
  const teacher = await userModel.findById(data.teacherId);
  if (!teacher || teacher.role !== 'teacher') {
    throw new Error('Teacher not found');
  }

  // Verify the course exists and the teacher is assigned to it
  const course = await courseModel.findById(data.courseId);
  if (!course) {
    throw new Error('Course not found');
  }

  if (course.teacherId !== data.teacherId) {
    throw new Error('Teacher is not assigned to this course');
  }

  // Create the material
  const material = await materialModel.create({
    ...data,
    uploadedAt: new Date(),
    status: data.status || 'draft'
  });

  return material;
}

/**
 * Get attendance records for a teacher's classes
 */
async getAttendanceRecords(teacherId: string, filters?: {
  classId?: string;
  date?: string;
  startDate?: string;
  endDate?: string;
}) {
  // Verify the teacher exists
  const teacher = await userModel.findById(teacherId);
  if (!teacher || teacher.role !== 'teacher') {
    throw new Error('Teacher not found');
  }

  // Get classes taught by the teacher
  const classes = await classModel.findByTeacherId(teacherId);
  const classIds = classes.map(cls => cls.id);

  if (filters?.classId && !classIds.includes(filters.classId)) {
    throw new Error('Teacher is not assigned to this class');
  }

  // Build query filters
  const query: any = {
    classId: filters?.classId ? filters.classId : { $in: classIds }
  };

  if (filters?.date) {
    query.date = filters.date;
  } else if (filters?.startDate || filters?.endDate) {
    query.date = {};
    if (filters?.startDate) query.date.$gte = filters.startDate;
    if (filters?.endDate) query.date.$lte = filters.endDate;
  }

  // Fetch attendance records
  const records = await attendanceModel.findByFilters(query);
  return records;
}
```

### Required API Routes

To support these new controller methods, the following routes should be added to the backend:

```typescript
// Teacher routes
const teacherRouter = Router();

// Apply authentication middleware
teacherRouter.use(authenticate);
teacherRouter.use(authorize(['teacher']));

// Material management routes
teacherRouter.get('/materials', teacherController.getMaterials);
teacherRouter.post('/materials', teacherController.createMaterial);
teacherRouter.put('/materials/:materialId', teacherController.updateMaterial);
teacherRouter.delete('/materials/:materialId', teacherController.deleteMaterial);

// Attendance management routes
teacherRouter.get('/attendance', teacherController.getAttendanceRecords);
teacherRouter.post('/attendance', upload.none(), teacherController.submitAttendance);
teacherRouter.get('/attendance/stats', teacherController.getAttendanceStats);
teacherRouter.post('/attendance/notify', teacherController.notifyAbsentStudents);

// Document management routes
teacherRouter.get('/documents', teacherController.getDocuments);
teacherRouter.post('/documents', upload.single('file'), teacherController.uploadDocument);
teacherRouter.delete('/documents/:documentId', teacherController.deleteDocument);

// Register these routes in app.ts
app.use('/api/teachers', teacherRouter);
```

### Implementation Priority

1. **Assignments Management**:
   - Leverage existing assignment controller but add teacher-specific endpoints
   - Implement methods for creating and grading assignments

2. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Implement attendance submission and retrieval
   - Add attendance statistics and reporting

3. **Materials Management**:
   - Create endpoints for uploading and managing course materials
   - Implement course-specific material organization

4. **Document Management**:
   - Add document upload and management capabilities
   - Implement storage and retrieval functionality

### Integration with Frontend

The existing frontend services like `assignmentService`, `attendanceService`, and `teacherService` should be updated to use these new endpoints instead of mock data, ensuring a seamless experience for teachers using the platform.

## Conclusion

PFE-Gestion-Scolaire is a comprehensive school management system with a modern technical stack and a well-structured architecture. The system provides a wide range of features for different user roles, making it suitable for educational institutions of various sizes. The use of TypeScript, React, and Express.js with a MySQL database provides a solid foundation for maintainability and scalability.
