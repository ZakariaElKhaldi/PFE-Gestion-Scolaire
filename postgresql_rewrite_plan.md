# PostgreSQL Rewrite Plan

## I. Goals and Scope:

*   Define core backend functionality for the initial release.
*   Identify and defer non-essential features.
*   Establish performance and scalability goals.

## II. Technology Stack:

*   Programming Language: TypeScript (consistent with existing backend)
*   Backend Framework: NestJS (Node.js framework for scalable server-side applications)
*   Database: PostgreSQL
*   ORM/Query Builder: Prisma or TypeORM (modern, type-safe ORMs)
*   Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
*   API Style: RESTful API or GraphQL
*   Testing Framework: Jest (consistent with existing devDependencies)

## III. Architecture:

*   Layered Architecture:
    *   Controllers: Handle requests, route to services.
    *   Services: Implement business logic.
    *   Models: Define data structures.
    *   Data Access Layer: Abstract database access (Prisma/TypeORM).
*   Dependency Injection: Manage dependencies, improve testability.

## IV. Database Schema Design:

*   Translate existing MySQL schema to PostgreSQL.
*   Use UUIDs for primary keys.
*   Use appropriate data types.
*   Create indexes for performance.
*   Consider PostgreSQL-specific features (e.g., JSONB).

## V. Implementation Steps:

1.  Set up the development environment:
    *   Install Node.js and npm/yarn.
    *   Install PostgreSQL and configure a development database.
    *   Create a new NestJS project using the Nest CLI: `nest new project-name`.
    *   Install Prisma or TypeORM: `npm install @prisma/client prisma` or `npm install typeorm mysql2 pg`.
    *   Configure Prisma or TypeORM to connect to the PostgreSQL database:
        *   Create a database connection configuration file (e.g., `prisma/schema.prisma` or `ormconfig.json`).
        *   Define the database connection string using environment variables.
2.  Implement the core models:
    *   Define the Prisma or TypeORM models for the core entities (e.g., User, Course, Class):
        *   Use Prisma Migrate or TypeORM migrations to create the database schema.
        *   Define relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
        *   Implement validation rules for each model.
3.  Implement the data access layer:
    *   Create services to interact with the database using Prisma or TypeORM:
        *   Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity.
        *   Use transactions to ensure data consistency.
        *   Implement pagination and filtering for list endpoints.
        *   Handle database errors gracefully.
4.  Implement the API endpoints:
    *   Create controllers to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate services:
        *   Use NestJS decorators to define routes, methods, and validation rules.
        *   Implement request validation using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
        *   Handle authentication and authorization.
        *   Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
5.  Implement authentication and authorization:
    *   Use JWT or a similar mechanism to protect the API endpoints:
        *   Implement user registration, login, and password reset functionality.
        *   Use middleware to authenticate requests.
        *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain resources.
        *   Consider using Passport.js or a similar library for authentication.
6.  Implement automated testing:
    *   Write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the quality of the codebase:
        *   Use Jest as the testing framework.
        *   Use Supertest to test API endpoints.
        *   Use mocking libraries (e.g., Jest mocks, Sinon) to isolate components during unit testing.
        *   Write tests for all critical functionality, including:
            *   Model validation.
            *   Service logic.
            *   API endpoints.
            *   Authentication and authorization.
7.  Implement Real-time Sync (if needed):
    *   Setup Socket.IO for real-time data synchronization between client and server.
    *   Implement logic to handle create, update, and delete events.
    *   Ensure proper authentication and authorization for socket connections.
8.  Implement File Upload Functionality:
    *   Integrate Multer for handling file uploads.
    *   Configure file storage (local, cloud).
    *   Implement validation for file types and sizes.
9.  Implement Email Functionality:
    *   Setup Nodemailer for sending emails.
    *   Create email templates for various events (e.g., registration, password reset).
    *   Configure email sending settings (SMTP, API).
10. Implement Background Jobs:
    *   Use BullMQ or similar for handling background tasks (e.g., sending emails, generating reports).
    *   Configure queues and workers.
11. Implement Caching:
    *   Use Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data.
    *   Configure cache expiration policies.
12. Implement Logging and Monitoring:
    *   Use Winston or similar for logging application events.
    *   Configure logging levels and destinations.
    *   Integrate with a monitoring service (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application performance and health.

## VI. Testing Strategy:

*   Unit Tests: Test individual components in isolation.
*   Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different components.
*   End-to-End Tests: Test the entire application from end to end.
*   Use Jest as the testing framework.
*   Use a separate test database to avoid affecting the development or production data.

## VII. Deployment:

*   Choose a deployment platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku).
*   Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
*   Configure monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of the application.

## VIII. Migration Strategy:

*   If possible, consider a gradual migration strategy:
    *   Implement new features in the new PostgreSQL backend.
    *   Migrate existing features incrementally.
    *   Use a proxy or API gateway to route requests to the appropriate backend.

## IX. Timeline and Resources:

*   Estimate the time and resources required for each step of the rewrite.
*   Allocate sufficient resources to ensure the success of the project.

## X. Risk Assessment:

*   Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
    *   Common risks include:
        *   Lack of PostgreSQL expertise.
        *   Unexpected technical challenges.
        *   Scope creep.
        *   Communication issues.
